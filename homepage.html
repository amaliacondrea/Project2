                So… you have been injured or have some condition that requires you to visit a qualified healthcare 
                practitioner (i.e. a physical therapist). Were you given “homework?” In other words, did the 
                practitioner give you a home exercise program, commonly called an H.E.P., to assist you in your road to
                recovery? If so, it is highly advisable to follow through and actually do what your practitioner has 
                prescribed to you. Not doing so could certainly lead to a longer recovery or no recovery at all! Who 
                wants that? What is the use of seeking professional advice if you have no follow through on your part?  
                Healthcare clinicians (aka practitioners) are not magicians! Taking care of yourself requires your 
                active participation!
